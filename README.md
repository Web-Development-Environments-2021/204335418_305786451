## Our Extras!
* Added an option to shoot the quick monsters! Each new game sets you up with 5 special-one-use-disposable LASER GUNS! But use it carefully, you might destroy your delicious 50 points worth of burger as well!
* Also, be prepared! Because in any random time during the game, you get A 10 SECONDS CHANCE of eating the special clock that earns you additional 15 seconds! Sweet!
